1. Layers of the structure
2. Two manual inputs, or however many the user wants depending on the size of the first layer
3. This line determines whether the weights inputted are "manual" or "random"
4. The first layer (kj) of manually inputted weights
5. The second layer (ji) of manually inputted weights
6. The error threshold value
7. The value for lambda
8. The value that lambda changes by (lambda adapt)
9. How many iterations the program is allowed to run before stopping
10. The minimum value for the initial random weights
11. The maximum value for the initial random weights
12. How many test cases there are
13-n. The test case inputs
